	<h1>Project 3: 2.5D Virtual Environment</h1>
	<p>
		Had to create atleast 6 assests and make a 2.5D envirnoment using animation via p5.js

		Jumpled around on a few ideas

		Finally decided to make a 2.5D trip through a valley

		started with these sketches
			sketches:

		then placed them in code

		After I finished I felt that I achieved the 2.5D environment, the hardest part for me was coming up with an idea. Making the assests was fun and I increased my painting skill level.

		I learned about how not to upload image files to p5.js and I learned a little about how to paint with a mixer brush and gradient tool

	<h1>Project 2: The Augmented Body</h1>
	<p>
		For this project we had to compose three different images with different line styles using p5.js.

		The Thinker, a bronze sculpture by Auguste Rodin.

		My second composition started and ended a few different times. It took a few tries to figure out what I wanted to do. Bezier curves weren’t too bad just took sometime to get the control points right. I decided to create lines flowing through his body. I tried to make all the lines connect to make it seem contininous until they reach the end of the sculptures body. After I finished the second one it became my favorite.

		I felt a little confined after my first two I wanted to do something completely different for the third. At first I wanted to have sunlight rays hitting off the sculpture and bouncing off. First I created a more rough outline compared to my first outline. And added fill so they had different color between each section of his section. I couldn’t get the rays to look just right on him so I decided the bezier curves should connect to him like he was plugged in to something. After I did this it seemed like I had a cyberpunk theme going on with my third piece which I’m a huge fan of. This one instantly conquered the throne for being my favorite.

		Decided to make a new composition that changes the color of the sections on his body every update() in draw. Although not part of the “static image” requirmenet I wanted to make something that truluy completed my piece.

		This project was really fun. Although it took a bit longer to plug in the coordinates it was well worth it. I didn’t think creative coding would be this fun. Excited to do more projects and learn more.

	<h1>Project 1: Generative Art</h1>
	<p>
		First project idea is to have crypto currencies move into a different position around the moon with each play/click.

		I had trouble with uploading images because they were too big. Solved by generating assets of the .psd files. This was tedious but now all crypto coins are uploading on p5.js web editor.

		Also made a space background in photoshop and uploaded to p5.js web editor. I got the crypto currencies to rotate positions based on a switch. No random function implemented.

		Ended with updated p5.js with a moon and positions of currencies. Thinking about changing my project to something more interesting. Left class thinking of ideas of ways I can change it.

		Ended up changing my idea and working on the project. Instead of doing crypto currencies revolving around the moon. I made pictures of an apple being eaten on photoshop and uploaded the pictures on p5.js.

		It took me awhile figuring out how to loop through the pictures with each click. I tried mixtures of for loops and switch statements in different functions before I solved my problem. Ended up using a switch statement and the value of the expression incremented with each click. I also found images of an orange being eaten on google and uploaded them on p5.js. Using the same structure as the apple it was easy to implement the orange switch statement.

		By the end of the day, I coded two generative ellipse plates for each fruit (they change size with each click) and changed the background color with each run.

		My final project ended up being a completley different thing than I first imagined. I learned more on photoshop, how to generate random sized shapes, and how to change there color with each run.
